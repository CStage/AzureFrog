Quickly copy a pretty link from Azure DevOps, so you can send it to your "best" coworkers and/or "friends"!

**For example:**
<br>
This link was created using Azure Frog!

Azure Frog is the stupid brainchild of Christian "_No Middle Name_" Stage, with important contributions from Peter Heltoft and critical moral support from Rune Riber and Axel "_A Million Middle Names_" Abildtrup. Thank you for inspiring me to create this absolute masterpiece.

## What's new in Version 1.4?

**Copying review requests directly from a PR**
<br>
It is now possible to copy review requests directly from a pull request in Azure DevOps. In the example below, the resulting clipboard entry will be:

**Copying for PR Template in Toolkit**
<br>
It is now possible to copy as PR-template-link from Toolkit. The functionality has only been tested for Cases and Bug reports, but should work for any list item. In the example below, the resulting clipboard entry will be:
<br>
